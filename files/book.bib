   Abstract = {The exposure to hazards associated with electrical arcing phenomena, while working on energized equipment is a topic of significant interest to industrial plant personnel. This paper provides an overview of the current arc flash standards, focusing on the methods used to calculate incident energy levels in a system. A thorough sensitivity analysis of the arc flash hazard incident energy calculations currently adopted by the IEEE 1584 standard leads to some possible conservative simplification of the equations. These simple equations could be used for a quick "first-cut" assessment of the incident energy levels present in a system. A case study, using data from a typical petrochemical application, provides a comparison of the NFPA 70E and IEEE 1584 arc flash incident energy equations and the results obtained using the proposed simplified calculations.},

   Abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of differentiating inrush currents from fault currents that are observed for a feeder at a distribution substation. This problem is important for feeder protection and power-quality monitoring purposes. The paper shows, using the actual field data, that it is not always easy to distinguish inrush currents from fault currents-as they do not have always well-defined waveforms. This paper shows that the two approaches-the Fourier transform, and the Wavelet transform can be adopted to extract features that make it possible to distinguish them from each other by using an artificial-neural-network-based classifier. The paper also illustrates how to address the issues for successful implementation of these schemes; such as prescreening of data, how to apply fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet transform on the data, and the training of the artificial neural network in order to maximize the performance of the classifier. These issues are illustrated using the actual field data. The test results indicate that both FFT-based and wavelet-transform (WT)-based classifiers yield good results, but the WT-based classifier has better performance.},

   Abstract = {<sup>T</sup>his paper summarizes a power quality (PQ) monitoring investigation conducted at the utility distribution substation level. The main goal was to determine the real-time PQ monitoring issues from the user's perspective: what type of data needs to be captured; and how it should be presented to the user. These issues have been investigated from a supply (utility) point of view, rather than the demand (customer) side view. The investigation involved installing three relays with PQ monitoring capability (ABB DPU2000R) to monitor the voltage quality at three distribution substations of Carolina Power and Light - A Progress Energy Company in North Carolina, USA. The PQ field data captured by these devices is then analyzed and presented to the user (CP&amp;L PQ engineers) to see if the data provides the appropriate information to the user. The paper summarizes the typical voltage quality events monitored and also their presentation to the user. The paper shows that the PQ devices used facilitate the PQ monitoring effectively, in that they provide the user the PQ data in a form that minimizes the data manipulation. In particular, the paper illustrates how the user can use the PQ data directly to construct the voltage sag and outage profiles for a distribution substation},

   Abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical investigation of the capability of popular digital filters used in relaying applications to suppress DC offset in current waveforms over a broad range of time constants as encountered on real power systems. First, three mathematical performance indices are introduced to be able to compare filters on the same basis. Then the concept of the FIR type of digital mimic filter is described. It is shown that, for filters exhibiting a null response at frequency zero on their frequency response, the addition of a digital mimic circuit, tuned to the middle of the range of time constants to be suppressed, will almost completely eliminate the effect of an exponentially decaying component. Moreover, this is possible without sacrificing the original response speed, although it increases susceptibility to noisy components},

   Abstract = {Coordination of protective devices on electrical distribution systems always involves the calculation of fault currents. These calculations almost always include a minimum fault current value. This minimum fault current value is not a bolted fault calculation; it includes an assumed impedance. Many utilities have assumed this impedance to be 40 &Omega;. This paper examines that assumption and provides some guidance on this issue. This paper is based on a study sponsored by the Cooperative Research Network, a division of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, based in Arlington, VA. This original study was completed in 1997},

   Abstract = {Quick restoration of power following an outage has been a challenge for power distribution engineers. Searchers have drawn attention to this problem by proposing methods for location of outages in distribution systems. The method presented in this paper for outage location is based on statistical hypotheses testing. The input data consists of time-of-outage measurements obtained from customer-ends. The effect of various levels of noise in the measurements on performance of the method is studied. A procedure for discarding outliers in the measurements is included. A theoretical procedure to determine the maximum noise allowed in the measurements is presented. Performance of the method at different locations in a test system is also studied},

   Abstract = {In this paper a new numerical algorithm for arcing faults detection and fault distance estimation is presented. The solution is given in the time domain. It is based on the line terminal voltages and currents processing. A simple new mathematical model of arc voltage is introduced in the estimation. Thereby, the more accurate approach to fault location is derived, particularly for the close-in faults. The new algorithm can be utilized for blocking the automatic reclosing. The unknown model parameters, including the line resistance and inductance, fault resistance and arc voltage amplitude, are estimated by using the least error squares method. The new algorithm is successfully tested through computer simulation and laboratory tests},

   Abstract = {An adaptive fault detection/location technique based on a phasor measurement unit (PMU) for an EHV/UHV transmission line is presented. A fault detection/location index in terms of Clarke components of the synchronized voltage and current phasors is derived. The line parameter estimation algorithm is also developed to solve the uncertainty of parameters caused by aging of transmission lines. This paper also proposes a new discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based algorithm (termed the smart discrete Fourier transform, SDFT) to eliminate system noise and measurement errors such that extremely accurate fundamental frequency components can be extracted for calculation of fault detection/location index. The EMTP was used to simulate a high voltage transmission line with faults at various locations. To simulate errors involved in measurements, Gaussian-type noise has been added to the raw output data generated by EMTP. Results have shown that the new DFT based method can extract exact phasors in the presence of frequency deviation and harmonics. The parameter estimation algorithm can also trace exact parameters very well. The accuracy of both new DFT based method and parameter estimation algorithm can achieve even up to 99.999% and 99.99% respectively, and is presented in Part II. The accuracy of fault location estimation by the proposed technique can achieve even up to 99.9% in the performance evaluation, which is also presented in Part II},

The extremely high temperatures of these arcs, about four times as high as that of the sun's surface, can cause fatal burns at up to about 5 ft (152 cm), and major burns at up to about 10 ft (305 cm) distance. Information for evaluation of the degree of hazard involved with various voltages and capacity ratings of equipment is developed and the required precautions and protective means to avoid injury from this source are outlined.},

   Abstract = {In this paper, methods and analysis of a simple wireless sensor concept for detecting and locating faults as well as for load monitoring are presented. The concept is based on distributed wireless sensors that are attached to the incoming and outgoing power lines of secondary substations. A sensor measures only phase current characteristics of the wire it is attached to, is not synchronized to other sensors and does not need configuration of triggering levels. The main novelty of the concept is in detecting and locating faults by combining power distribution network characteristics on system level with low power sampling methods for individual sensors. This concept enables the sensor design to be simple, energy efficient and thus applicable in new installations and for retrofit purposes in both overhead and underground electrical distribution systems.},

To achieve these objectives we planned and installed power quality monitoring and load monitoring in all of the substations on our system. We also use the monitoring system to control substation and feeder capacitors. The system also provides substation controls and alarms},

   Abstract = {In this paper a novel two-stage numerical algorithm devoted to fault distance calculation and arcing faults recognition is presented. The first algorithm stage serves for the fault distance calculation. Fault distance is calculated from the fundamental frequency phase voltages and currents phasors, utilizing the positive-and zero-sequence impedance of the line as an input parameter. The second algorithm stage serves for the arc voltage amplitude calculation. It utilizes the fault distance obtained from the first algorithm stage and the third harmonics of the terminal phase voltages and line currents phasors as input parameters. From the calculated value of arc voltage amplitude it can be concluded if the fault is transient arcing fault or permanent arcless fault. The phasors needed for algorithm development are calculated by using the discrete Fourier technique. In the paper the solution for the most frequent phase-to-ground faults is given. The results of algorithm testing through computer simulation and processing of real field data records are given.},

   Abstract = {In this paper, an overhead lines protection numerical algorithm, based on one terminal data and derived in the time domain, is presented. The fault location, direction and its nature (arcing or arcless fault) are estimated using the least error squares technique. The faulted phase voltage is modeled as a serial connection of fault resistance and arc voltage, offering more sophisticated line protection. The algorithm can be applied for both ordinary and the high impedance faults detection, distance protection, intelligent autoreclosure, as well as for the purpose of directional relaying. The approach presented does not require the line zero sequence resistance as an input datum. The algorithm is derived for the case of the most frequent single-phase to ground unsymmetrical faults. The results of algorithm testing through computer simulation are given. The influence of remote infeed, fault resistance, higher order harmonies, power system frequency, network topology, line parameters and other factors are investigated and systematically presented. Finally, an example of real life data processing is given},

The restrictions imposed by the load models proposed so far are discussed in the paper, and a new modelling methodology, referred to as the `fast response model' is proposed. New models for load elements, experimentally based and suitable for that application, are presented and aggregated at the distribution transformer level. The behaviour of the proposed models is compared with the methodologies used for that purpose, through the evaluation of their response under unbalanced abnormal voltage situations. As shown in the paper, the consideration of these models in fault location algorithms can enhance the accuracy of the location process},

   Abstract = {Fault location is of considerable interest for utilities to improve their reliability and speed storm restorations. Power quality recorders, relays, and other monitors can provide information to help locate faults. In this paper, some basic impedance-based fault-location methods are evaluated on utility measurement data with known fault locations. The main finding is that reasonably accurate fault locations are possible on a wide range of distribution circuits with either feeder-level or bus-level substation monitoring. Another important finding described is how monitoring can be used to estimate the parameters of the fault arc. This can improve fault locations and help with accident investigations, equipment failure forensics, and other hazards related to the power and energy created by the arc},

   Abstract = {The arc flash hazard calculation method proposed in IEEE 1584 is based on tests with the arcing electrodes in a vertical plane and the calorimeters arranged at 90/spl deg/ to this plane. In this paper the results of tests using the IEEE test set-up with both vertical and horizontal electrodes are given. High-speed videography and incident energy measurements show that the arc flash hazard is much worse with the horizontal orientation. However current-limiting fuses are effective in limiting the incident energy, even in worst-case arcing conditions, provided that the bolted-fault current is high enough to cause them to operate in their current-limiting mode. The incident energy values are shown to depend on the size of the trigger fuse wire used. The effect of phase imbalance is also considered.},

   Pages = {120-125},
   Abstract = {Low voltage arc flash testing has been conducted using the standard IEEE1584 test procedure, but with the electrode tips terminated in an insulating barrier instead of in the open air. The barrier prevents downwards arc motion, has a stabilizing effect on the arcs, and produces a strong horizontal plasma cloud flow. It also produces shorter arc lengths, higher arcing currents and higher maximum incident energy density, when compared with the standard arrangement. Erosion of the copper electrodes is very high and this causes a much larger quantity of copper spray to be directed towards the outside of the box. Similar results can be observed when vertical conductors are terminated in real industrial components. The effect of the barrier and the source X/R on arc sustainability at 208V has also been studied. The barrier test arrangement is believed to be more representative of real-world equipment. It is proposed that an arrangement like this should be incorporated into future revisions of the IEEE 1584 testing standard.},

   Abstract = {In 2002, two Pacific Northwest Utilities placed new distribution automation technology solutions into service at four substations with a total of ten distribution feeders. These solutions use commercial-off-the-shelf control technology to closely control distribution voltages to reduce energy usage and control demand. The first system at Inland Power and Light Company, a cooperative in Eastern Washington, went into service in April 2002, and the other three at Clatskanie PUD in Oregon went into service in November 2002. Avista Utilities is installing this new technology at the time of this writing. This paper presents the results of the ongoing operation and tests at these four rural substations. It will also describe the results that other utilities could expect when this technology is used to implement demand control, load management and conservation voltage regulation.},

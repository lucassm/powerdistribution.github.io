<h2>Conductor Slapping App</h2>

This app models slapping between two conductors for a line-to-line
fault involving these conductors. Enter the conductor and line
characteristics, the fault information, and the relative conductor
positions. The critical clearing time is the fault duration at which
conductors swing enough to (nearly) touch.

## Notes

The magnetic field from fault current produces forces between
conductors all along the circuit from the substation to the initial
fault location. These forces can cause conductors to swing. If they
swing together, a second fault can occur upstream of the initial
fault. The main scenario that causes the most issues is where the
initial fault is downstream of a recloser, and a follow-on fault
occurs upstream of the recloser and trips the circuit breaker.

The animation at the right is a view along the length of the line. The
two stationary conductor positions at the pole are shown. The two dots
that move are the conductor positions at the center of the span.

Conductor motion is a function of fault current, fault duration, phase
spacings, span lengths, and conductor sag. A line-to-line fault causes
the most force between two conductors. This app only models
line-to-line faults. The force from fault current pushes conductors
away from each other. Once the fault is cleared, the conductors can
swing into each other.

You can get some crazy answers with large forces (high fault currents
and/or long durations), especially for smaller conductors. The
conductor animations should show this.

This model is likely to be most accurate with horizontal spacings.
Vertical clearance definitely helps as you will see from the
animations and the critical clearing curves. However, there are some
cases with vertical spacing that show no slapping that probably would
touch in real life. Again, use your judgement, and review the
animations.

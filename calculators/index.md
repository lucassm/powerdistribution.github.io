# Distribution apps and calculators

- [IEEE 1584 arc flash](mdpad.html?1584.md)
- [Overhead line impedance calculator](mdpad.html?impedances.md)

Right now, these are all rather beta quality and/or simplistic. Use
caution! No warranty!

If you have ideas for additional calculators or wish to contribute,
please let [me](mailto:t.short@ieee.org) know.

# In progress

- Arc flash in a padmounted switch
- Ferroresonance on 5-legged core transformers
- Transients on urban primary systems
- Conductor slapping

# Options for more...

- SAIDI/SAIFI predictor
- Duke sectionalizing calculator(s)
- Stray voltage calculator
- Ampacity
- Harmonic resonance calculator
- Fuse saving calculator

# Distribution apps and calculators

- [Conductor slapping](mdpad.html?conductor_slapping.md)
- [IEEE 1584 arc flash](mdpad.html?1584.md)
- [Arc flash in a padmounted switch](mdpad.html?arc_flash_padsw.md)
- [Overhead line impedance calculator](mdpad.html?impedances.md)
- [CVR: customer vs. utility savings](mdpad.html?cvr.md)
- [Voltage impacts of distributed generation](mdpad.html?dg.md)

- [Transients on urban primary systems](mdpad.html?UrbanPrimary.md)

Right now, these are all rather beta quality. **Use caution! No
warranty!** These apps work best with a recent version of Firefox or
Chrome. Most of them will work with Internet Explorer 11, albeit with
a few quirks; only a few of the apps work with Internet Explorer 9 or
earlier versions.

If you find bugs, have ideas for additional calculators, or wish to
contribute, please let [me](mailto:t.short@ieee.org) know.

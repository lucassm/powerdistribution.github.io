# Distribution apps and calculators

- [Conductor slapping](mdpad.html?conductor_slapping.md)
- [IEEE 1584 arc flash](mdpad.html?1584.md)
- [Arc flash in a padmounted switch](mdpad.html?arc_flash_padsw.md)
- [Overhead line impedance calculator](mdpad.html?impedances.md)
- [Conservation voltage reduction&mdashcustomer vs. utility savings](mdpad.html?cvr.md)
- [Ferroresonance on 5-legged core transformers](mdpad.html?ferro.md)
- [Transients on urban primary systems](mdpad.html?UrbanPrimary.md)

Right now, these are all rather beta quality and/or simplistic. **Use
caution! No warranty!** You will likely need a recent version of Firefox
or Chrome for these calculators.

If you find bugs, have ideas for additional calculators, or wish to
contribute, please let [me](mailto:t.short@ieee.org) know.

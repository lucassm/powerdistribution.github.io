## Problems

0. If a 25-kV distribution line carrying 10 MW is stepped down to
   12.5-kV, how much power is the 12.5-kV line carrying?

0. For the previous question, find the current on each phase for both
   the 12.5- and 25-kV circuits.

0. On a 12.5-kV circuit with an average current of 200 A and a load
   factor of 0.5, what is the peak current?

0. Three loads have peak loads of 300 kW, 200 kW, and 225 kW
   respectively. Approximately what is the combined peak load of the 
   three loads?

##  Projects

0. Look around the distribution circuits in your area. Take pictures
   of each of the following:

   - Distribution primary mainline line
   - Distribution substation
   - Recloser
   - Capacitor bank
   - Fuse cutout
   - Distribution secondary

0. From your house or other convenient location with overhead distribution. Trace the
   circuit back to the substation. 

0. Using a university technical library or IEEE Xplore, find three
   historical papers or articles discussing a particular (technical or
   economic) issue associated with higher-voltage distribution
   circuits. Issues could include reliability, reach, grounding,
   equipment performance, or cost. Write a short essay summarizing the
   three papers and the issue identified.

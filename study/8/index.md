0. When using station-class arresters on distribution circuits to
   protect customers against overbuilt to underbuilt faults, which of

   1. Station arresters are used because they have a higher energy
      rating, so they can handle energies involved.
   2. Station arresters have a lower clamping voltage than other
      arresters on the circuit.
   3. Isolators are not used, because we want the arresters to stay in
      the circuit.

   best you can as well as any options that might have prevented it.

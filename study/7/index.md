0. A capacitor will raise the voltage upstream of the bank.

   1. True
   1. False

0. Reactive power is due largely to which of the following:

   1. Motors
   1. Electronic loads
   1. Transformers
   1. Cables

0. If a feeder has 1000 kvar of load, what would be the optimal size
   of each cap bank if two capacitors are applied at optimal
   locations?
   
   1. 200 kvar
   1. 333 kvar
   1. 400 kvar

   adding a capacitor bank.

   1. False

0. Is an 80 K fuse link an acceptable application on 900-kvar bank on
   a 12.5-kV system.

   1. Yes
   1. No

0. Which options can minimize the likelihood of nuisance fuse
   operations on capacitor cutouts? Mark all that apply.

   1. Tighten fuseholder caps
   1. Use conductive grease
   1. Replace the fuse liner when needed
   1. Do not fuse too tightly

## Problems

0. What is the voltage rise after adding a 3-phase, 3-Mvar capacitor
   bank (12.5 kV, 3-phase short circuit at the point = 2 kA, X/R=4)?

0. Consider a 12.5-kV express circuit that is four miles long with
   350-kcmil AAC construction with Z<sub>1</sub> = 0.0557 + j 0.1242
   ohms/kfeet. Find the amount of capacitance in kvar needed to have
   zero voltage drop.

0. For a 1200-kvar capacitor bank on a 12.5-kV distribution circuit,
   calculate the I<sup>2</sup>t for peak outrush into a nearby fault
   where the resistance between the capacitor and the fault is 0.02
   ohms. Find V<sub>pu</sub> needed to for the I<sup>2</sup>t to
   exceed that necessary to blow a 30T fuse.


## Projects

0. Using the 
   [IEEE 8500-node test case](http://svn.code.sf.net/p/electricdss/code/trunk/Distrib/IEEETestCases/8500-Node/)
   in OpenDSS, find the losses for each of the following cases. Solve
   the system at peak load.

   - Base case.
   - Remove all capacitors.
   - Add 1200-kvar fixed capacitors based on the 1/2-kvar method.
   - Add 600-kvar fixed capacitors based on the 1/2-kvar method.

# 7. Capacitor Application

## Questions

0. Substation capacitor banks: (mark all that apply)

   1. Are cheaper than the equivalent amount of capacitor banks installed on a feeder
   1. Reduce feeder losses
   1. Help reduce feeder voltage drop

0. A capacitor will raise the voltage upstream of the bank.

   1. True
   1. False

0. Reactive power is due largely to which of the following:

   1. Motors
   1. Electronic loads
   1. Transformers
   1. Cables

0. If a feeder has 1000 kvar of load, what would be the optimal size
   of each cap bank if two capacitors are applied at optimal
   locations?
   
   1. 200 kvar
   1. 333 kvar
   1. 400 kvar

0. Voltage drop due to a large resistive heating load can be reduced
   by switching in a capacitor bank.
   
   1. True
   1. False

0. Line losses due to a large resistive heating load can be reduced by
   adding a capacitor bank.
   
   1. True
   1. False


## Problems

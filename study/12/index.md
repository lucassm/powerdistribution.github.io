   surge protectors, what's a likely cause?

   1. Temporary overvoltages
   2. Inrush into electronics
   3. Reclose transients

2. If you have customer equipment damage, and damage appears to be in
   fuses, what's a likely cause?

   1. Temporary overvoltages
   2. Inrush into electronics
   3. Reclose transients

0.	Capacitor banks:
    1. Cause voltage flicker
    1. Help reduce voltage flicker caused by other loads
    1. Neither

0. A voltage flicker between 123 and 120 V once per second may cause
   complaints.
   
   1. True
   1. False

0. For a harmonic filter tuned to the 5th harmonic, if the inductor is

# 3. Overhead Line Performance

## Questions

0. Mark which of the following are true during major storms.
   
   1. Pole damage increases as a portion of damage.
   2. Downed conductors increase as a portion of damage.
   3. Outside crews are often needed.
   4. Tree damage is more acute.  

0. Thermal inspections can find which problems? Mark all that apply.
   
   1. Cutout problems
   2. Bad arresters
   3. Tracking insulators
   4. Cracked insulators
   5. Automatics with poor connections

0. Mark which of the following are true related to tree faults.
   
   1. Trees regularly cause momentary interruptions.
   2. Growth often accounts for 50% of vegetation outages. 
   3. 35-kV lines are considerable more susceptible to vegetation
      outages than 15-kV lines.
   4. Wet branches are more likely to fault than dry branches.

0. More vegetation clearance is better... (pick the best answer)

   1. If it removes branches that can fall into the line.
   2. So vegetation takes longer to grow into lines.
   
0. True/false: doubling vegetation management will cut in half
   tree-caused outages.

   1. True
   2. False
   
0. Animal faults are most common in which season?

   1. Winter
   2. Spring
   3. Summer
   
0. Animal faults happen most frequently where?

   1. Transformers
   2. Phase to phase
   3. Reclosers
   
0. True/false: animal guards should be placed as low on a bushing as possible.

   1. True
   2. False
   
0. Pole deterioration happens mainly where? Mark all that apply.

   1. In the outer 2 in of a pole
   2. Near ground line
   3. Near third party attachments
   
0. Vegetation faults are most common in which season?

   1. Winter
   2. Spring
   3. Summer
   
0. True/false: doubling vegetation management will cut in half
   tree-caused outages.

   1. True
   2. False

0. Relative to bare conductors, covered wire helps for which of the following? Mark all that apply.

   1. Ice loading
   2. Tree growth into conductors
   3. Downed conductors
   4. Small branches into conductors
   5. Trees falling into conductors

## Problems

0. Calculate the time it takes for a tree limb to cause a flashover on
   a 12.5-kV line with 4-ft phase spacings. Will it flash over?

   - Repeat for a 25-kV line.
   - Repeat for a 4.1-kV line.

0. Assume it costs $4800 / mile to prune at a four-year cycle, and
   costs rise an additional $700 / mile for every year added to that
   cycle. What's the optimal cycle just based on cost based on that
   linear relationship over the range of 4 to 12 years?
   
0. Assume it costs $4800 / mile to prune at a four-year cycle, and
   costs rise by a factor of 1.2 for every year added to that cycle.
   What's the optimal cycle just based on cost over the range of 4 to
   12 years?
   
0. Find the optimal maintenance cycle w (1 to 10 years) and the
   optimal hazard-tree removal program cycle h (1 to 10 years) with
   the following assumptions:

   - Tree SAIFI = 0.3 + w^2 / 100 
   - A hazard tree inspection reduces tree SAIFI by 0.05
   - Pruning = $4800 / mile
   - Hazard tree removal = $800 / mile
   - Annual budget = $1300 / mile

## Projects

0. Vegetation management

   Find an area that has just been pruned. Photograph these areas.
   Document what you think the pruning spec is based on what you saw.
   Include any advice for improvements.

0. Hazard trees

   Take a driving inspection (preferably with someone else driving) in
   an area with trees. Count how many hazard trees you identify in two
   miles of line. Take pictures and document. 


0. Animal issues

   Visit 5 poles on three-phase lines with equipment. Take pictures.
   Identify any animal-related design and/or protection defects.
   Document how it could have been avoided when built or upgraded and
   how it might be fixed now.

0. Overhead line issues

   Ride and/or walk distribution lines in your area. Photograph and
   document at least 10 deficiencies that could affect performance.
   Document the main problem, how it could have been avoided when
   built or upgraded, and how it might be fixed now.

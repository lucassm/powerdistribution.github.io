title:  Questions and Problems
---

*NOTE: This section is still under construction.*

This section contains several self-study exercises. Most chapters have
each of the following:

- *Questions* -- These are fairly straightforward and are mainly to
  probe for understanding.

- *Problems* -- These normally require at least a calculator and time
  to work through problems. 

- *Projects* -- These are in-depth problems that take considerable effort.

By chapter:

1.  [Fundamentals of Distribution Systems](1/)
2.  [Overhead Lines](2/)
3.  [Overhead Line Performance](3/)
4.  [Underground Distribution](4/)
5.  [Transformers](5/)
6.  [Voltage Regulation](6/)
7.  [Capacitor Application](7/)
8.  [Faults](8/)
9.  [Short-Circuit Protection](9/)
10. [Reliability](10/)
11. [Voltage Sags and Momentary Interruptions](11/)
12. [Other Power Quality Issues](12/)
13. [Lightning Protection](13/)
14. [Grounding and Safety](14/)
15. [Distributed Generation](15/)

Note that these exercises are still *beta quality*. They have not been
put to the test by students, yet. Please provide feedback. This
material is liberally licensed, so please feel free to use it however
you want. Feel free to use this material for coursework even if you
don't use the Handbook as a course reference. If you have suggestions
for more exercises, please let me know.

The *Questions* that focus on concepts may work well with the
[Peer Instruction](http://blog.peerinstruction.net/) approach to
instruction. With this approach, lectures incorporate concept-related
questions for interactive instruction. This has been used at
[Harvard University](http://mazur.harvard.edu/research/detailspage.php?ed=1&rowid=8)
for physics classes. 

Professors and other educators, please contact me if you need
Handbook-related materials (such as figures) for use in classes.

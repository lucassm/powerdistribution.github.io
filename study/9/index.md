   12.5 kV?
   
   1. Yes
   2. No
   
0. Will a 25-K fuse operate to clear most energized downed wires at
   12.5 kV?
   
   1. Yes
   2. No
   
0. What is the most common fault impedance?
   
   1. 1 ohm
   2. 20 ohms
   3. 40 ohms
   4. 10,000 ohms
   
0. What is the best value for worst-case fault impedance?
   
   1. 1 ohm
   2. 20 ohms
   3. 40 ohms
   4. 10,000 ohms


# Problems

Using Duke Power’s “Fundamental Law of Sectionalizing”, determine
the customer interruptions saved and the dollars per customer
interruption saved for the following scenarios:
   
1. Midpoint recloser

1. Tap reclosers

1. Two midpoint reclosers

1. Recloser loop

1. You have a 2-mile, three-phase tap with 80 customers. Should you
   fuse it or use single-phase reclosers? Use Duke’s “Fundamental Law
   of Sectionalizing” and their default costs. Assume 0.2 permanent
   faults per mile and 0.4 temporary faults per mile annually. Assume
   “fuse saving” is not an option.
   
# Projects

1. Make a spreadsheet or other tool to evaluate fuse saving and fuse blowing

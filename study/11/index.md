## 11. Voltage Sags and Momentary Interruptions

# Questions

1. An overhead circuit that uses fuse saving has 5 miles of mains and
   20 miles of total exposure. Annual line interruption rates are
   0.25/mile for permanent faults and 0.25/mile for temporary faults. The
   average annual momentary interruptions will be closest to which value?

   1. 2
   2. 5
   3. 10
   
2. Repeat for the same circuit with fuse blowing.

   1. 2
   2. 5
   3. 10
   
3. Which of the following are likely to ride through a 0.4-sec
   momentary interruption. Select all that apply.
   
   1. Computer workstation
   2. PLC controller
   3. Digital clock
   4. Adjustable-speed drive
   
4. For sags of 6 cycles or more, how much more frequent are sags to
   90% than are sags to 70%?
   
   1. 2X
   2. 1\.5X
   3. 1\.3X
   
5. For sags of 6 cycles or more, how much more frequent are sags to
   70% than are sags to 50%?

   1. 2X
   2. 1\.5X
   3. 1\.3X
   

# Problems

1. For a line-to-ground fault 2 miles from the substation, what does
   the bus voltage drop to? 12.47-kV system, Ifault=7 kA at the
   substation

   - Repeat for a fault 4 miles from the substation.
   - Repeat for a three-phase fault.
   - Repeat for a 25-kV system (line-to-ground fault).
   
2. A PQ monitor shows a voltage sag that dropped to 50% of nominal for
   a line-to-ground fault. About how far was the fault from the
   substation? 34.5-kV system, Ifault=10 kA at the substation
   
3. Repeat for a 12.47-kV system.

4. Need circuit map??. A critical customer is 4 miles from the
   substation. The customer is sensitive to sags that drop below 0.7
   per unit. Draw an area of vulnerability marking the area of circuit
   that can affect the customer. Estimate the number of events per
   year that could affect the customer. Assume the following:

   - 12\.47-kV
   - Ifault=7 kA at the substation
   - assume 1 ohm/mile of line impedance (line-to-ground faults)
   - 4 feeders fed from the station bus
   - fault rate = 0.5 faults/mile/year
   - 10 mile mainline.
   
   Show the vulnerability for momentary interruptions.

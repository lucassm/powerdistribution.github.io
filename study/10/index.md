# 10. Reliability

## Questions

1. SAIFI on a grid network is most likely to be:

   1. 1\.5/year
   2. 0\.15/year
   3. 0\.015/year
   
1. Given a circuit with a permanent fault rate of 0.2 faults/mi/year,
   which configuration would have the fewest average interruptions
   (assume that the customers are evenly distributed by line length):
   
   1. Mains = 10 miles, 10 laterals each 1-mile long
   2. Mains = 15 miles, 10 laterals each 0.5-mile long
   3. Mains = 10 miles, 20 laterals each 0.5-mile long
   4. Mains = 5 miles, 15 laterals each 1-mile long
   5. Mains = 5 miles, 30 laterals each 0.5-mile long
   
1. If SAIDI excluding storms is 90 minutes/year, what is it most
   likely to be when storms are included?
   
   1. 120 minutes
   2. 300 minutes
   3. 800 minutes
   
1. Adding one midpoint recloser to a circuit without other reclosers
   will reduce SAIFI to what percentage of the original? Assume
   customers and exposure are equal on both halves.
   
   1. 50%
   2. 75%
   3. 66%
   
1. “Riding the line” is an effective way to identify where faults
   occur.
   
   1. True
   2. False
   
1. A utility that classifies an average of 10 days per year as a storm
   for reliability reporting purposes:
   
   1. Is not playing fair
   1. Has good lawyers
   1. Is fudging the data
   1. Can occur with the IEEE beta method




## Problems

0. If a customer is fed from two distribution sources, find SAIFI and
   SAIDI for the customer if one circuit has SAIFI = 1.2/yr and SAIDI
   = 200 minutes/yr and the other has SAIFI = 2.0/yr and SAIDI = 400
   minutes/yr.

0. Now repeat the previous problem and include the reliability of the
   transfer switch feeding the facility which has an annual failure
   rate of 1% and a repair time of 24 hours.

0. If the distribution of daily SAIDI follows a lognormal
   distribution, what portion of annual average SAIDI (without
   exclusions) occurs in the worst 20 days? Assume that the average of
   the log of daily SAIDI (in minutes) is alpha = -1.5 and the
   standard deviation of the log of daily SAIDI is beta = 1.9.

0. Using the regression formulas for prediction of reliability,
   compare SAIFI without major events for the following two cases:

   1. 1,000,000 customers, 10,000 overhead line miles, and 20,000
      underground line miles
   1. 1,000,000 customers, 100,000 overhead line miles, and 20,000
      underground line miles

## 10. Reliability

# Questions

1. SAIFI on a grid network is most likely to be:

   1. 1\.5/year
   2. 0\.15/year
   3. 0\.015/year
   
1. Given a circuit with a permanent fault rate of 0.2 faults/mi/year,
   which configuration would have the fewest average interruptions
   (assume that the customers are evenly distributed by line length):
   
   1. Mains = 10 miles, 10 laterals each 1-mile long
   2. Mains = 15 miles, 10 laterals each 0.5-mile long
   3. Mains = 10 miles, 20 laterals each 0.5-mile long
   4. Mains = 5 miles, 15 laterals each 1-mile long
   5. Mains = 5 miles, 30 laterals each 0.5-mile long
   
1. If SAIDI excluding storms is 90 minutes/year, what is it most
   likely to be when storms are included?
   
   1. 120 minutes
   2. 300 minutes
   3. 800 minutes
   
1. Adding one midpoint recloser to a circuit without other reclosers
   will reduce SAIFI to what percentage of the original?
   
   1. 50%
   2. 75%
   3. 66%
   
1. “Riding the line” is an effective way to identify where faults
   occur.
   
   1. True
   2. False
   
1. A utility that classifies an average of 10 days per year as a storm
   for reliability reporting purposes:
   
   1. Is not playing fair
   2. Has good lawyers
   3. Is fudging the data
